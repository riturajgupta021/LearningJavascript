Welcome to the Project Title repository! This project is designed to help you get familiar with fundamental programming concepts, particularly focusing on arrays, conditionals, and loops. The repository is organized into different sections, each covering a specific topic.

# Repository Structure

# Array Folder:
-This folder contains various exercises and examples that demonstrate how to work with arrays in programming. You'll find code snippets that show how to create, access, modify, and iterate through arrays.

# Conditional Folder: 
-This folder includes examples and exercises on conditional statements such as if, else, switch, and more. These examples will help you understand how to control the flow of your program based on different conditions.
